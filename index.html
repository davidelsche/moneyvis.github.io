      <h3>By David Elsche, Sascha Collet</h3>
      <p>
        The world is determined by so many little factors
        that it is impossible to even begin to understand
        just those that are relevant to ourselves.
        Big numbers, on the other hand, are often so
        far beyond the scale of our daily experiences
        that they become hard to grasp. It is only when
        those big numbers are put into perspective that
        we begin to comprehend the sheer power that they possess.
        Let us have a look at that power.

    <div id="annotation-1" class="slide">
      <h2>100 $</h2>
      <div class="media">
          <img src="images/jeans.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        doesn’t seem like so much. You can get a nice pair
        of jeans for 100$ or maybe some shoes. But let’s
        talk about more important things than clothing.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="annotation-2" class="slide">
      <h2>10.000 $</h2>
      <img src="images/seeds.png" alt="">
      <p>
        can make a real difference. With that money,
        aid organizations could buy 33 tons of millet
        seeds, which can feed a lot of people. Farmers
        in developing countries often lack the money to
        raise crops - leading to famine and death which
        could otherwise be averted. Let’s see what we can
        do with a bit more money.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="annotation-3" class="slide">
      <h2>100.000 $</h2>
      <div class="media">
          <img src="images/teacher.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        will pay for the education of 550 Kenyan children
        who otherwise would not learn how to read and write.
        550 children that could change the future of their families.
        Imagine what millions could pay for.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="annotation-4" class="slide">
      <h2>8.500.000 $</h2>
      <div class="media">
          <img src="images/tank.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        is the cost of one battle tank. But military equipment gets
        even more expensive - if you are going for modern warfare.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="annotation-5" class="slide">
      <h2>50.000.000 $</h2>
      <div class="media">
          <img src="images/drone.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        will buy you even more efficient killing machines -
        3 Predator drones. Just imagine how much good you could
        do with that kind of money. But let’s put that into perspective.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="annotation-6" class="slide">
      <h2>25.600.000.000 $</h2>
      <div class="media">
          <img src="images/aid.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        This is the total budget for the U.S. Agency for International
        Development, an organization within the Department of State,
        which incidentally amounts to 28% less than the 2017 annualized
        continuing resolution. Still a lot of money for helping people,
        to be fair. Let’s see what’s reserved for the military.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div id="annotation-7" class="slide">>
      <h2>639.000.000.000 $</h2>
      <div class="media">
          <img src="images/military.png" alt="">
      </div>
      <p>
        Trump’s budget for the Department of Defense is 8% higher compared
        to 2017. This corresponds to 10 billion less for saving lives and a
        solid 52 billion more for weapons. But it’s not about the numbers -
        it’s about what they stand for. Money can make a big difference.
